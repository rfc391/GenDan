## Overview
GenDan revolutionizes precision medicine by integrating genetic data with advanced analytics to identify and manage genetic disorders. This Python-based application combines innovation with healthcare expertise, driving advancements in genetic analysis and personalized treatment strategies.

## Key Features
- **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**: Kafka and RabbitMQ for scalable and reliable messaging.
- **AI Engine**: Integration with OpenCV, ONNX, and NVIDIA Triton for high-performance processing.
- **Secure Communication**: gRPC with Protobuf and Quiche/HTTP3 for low-latency and encrypted data exchange.
- **Databases**:
  - **Time-Series**: InfluxDB for real-time data analytics.
  - **Transactional**: Cloudflare D1/PostgreSQL for robust and compliant database management.
  - **Immutable Storage**: immudb with IPFS for tamper-proof and decentralized storage.
- **Security**:
  - Zero Trust architecture with Cloudflare.
  - Quantum-safe encryption using QKD and PQC.
- **Performance**: Optimized for edge computing with Cloudflare Workers and enhanced caching with Redis.
- **Standards**: Compliant with ISO 27001/27701, GDPR, and aligned with DARPA guidelines.
