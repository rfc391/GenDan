# Grafana Monitoring Configuration

1. **Set Up Grafana**:
   - Install Grafana and connect it to InfluxDB as the data source.
   - Configure dashboards to visualize:
     - CPU, Memory, Disk Usage
     - Application Latency, Throughput, Error Rates
     - Unauthorized Access Attempts

2. **Create Alerts**:
   - Trigger alerts on:
     - High CPU or Memory usage.
     - Application Latency > 500ms.
     - Unauthorized access attempts exceeding thresholds.

3. **Logging**:
   - Use structured JSON logs for easier analysis.
   - Forward logs to a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK Stack).
